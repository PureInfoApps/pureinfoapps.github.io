**Terms & Conditions**

By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. 

Pure Info Apps allows anyone to use the source code provided [here](https://github.com/chaudharydeepanshu/qr_and_barcode_master) with the exception that you are not allowed to use the Pure Info Apps(Organization) logo and QR & Barcode Master(App) logo if included in the source code.

Pure Info Apps is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.

The QR & Barcode Master app stores and processes data that you have provided to us, to provide our Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure.

Servives used in our app are:

*   [Google Analytics for Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/terms/analytics)
*   [Firebase Crashlytics](https://firebase.google.com/terms/crashlytics)

Pure Info Apps cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Pure Info Apps cannot accept responsibility.

With respect to Pure Info Apps’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. Pure Info Apps accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.

At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android – the requirements for the system(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. Pure Info Apps does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.
