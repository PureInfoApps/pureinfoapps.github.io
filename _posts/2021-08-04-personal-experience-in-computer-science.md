Since this is my first blog, I would begin by sharing my journey in science and technology. I've always been inspired to find out how everything around us works. And the most awesome thing for me was how the different programs worked and that's what led me to learn programming.

I studied computer science in my high school and I was taught C++ as the first programming language. And my interest in programming helped me get great grades in computer science in high school. When I first looked at the programming code, I found it rather surprising and also odd. I was a little afraid of having to learn these weird words and symbols, but after a while, I got used to it. 

Now, the next important step for me was to learn about creating something intuitive that has a user interface. Since I learned the basics of C++ I wanted to create a few small projects like a typing speed calculator with a user interface. But the biggest problem is that we haven't been taught that. So I did a web search and found out that there are frameworks and toolkits for that. Simply put, the framework and toolkits could help us create a program's user interface and these tools link the user interface code with the basic functionality code. This made me feel good that now I could create something that could be used by non-technical people.

Here, the main problem I found was that most schools don't teach us how to create projects that could be used by the general public. And this lack of knowledge already discourages many potential students not to take computer science in future studies. As they believe it is a very complex process and they would need to write thousands of files to create even a small application. In reality, however, that is not true. I agree that some applications require thousands of typed code files, but there is a whole team behind them and not every application needs that much code. Also, thanks to open source there are already a lot of libraries, frameworks, and toolkits freely available to use which would make this process much easier.

As my first project I created a calculator with a user interface. Yes, I know I wanted to convert my terminal typing speed calculator into an UI based typing speed calculator. But I didn't want to do it because I wanted to learn new programming languages that were supported by big platforms. So I started learning Kotlin because it is a popular language and recommended by Google for Android. So I began to learn and I found that it was similar to c++ and I learned that most programming languages use a similar structure and terminology in most cases. So it wasn't too difficult for me to make the transition.

The next step was to learn Android studio. Working with an Android studio for the first time felt quite overwhelming as I never used any software of this size with so many options.  I went through tutorials and started learning. I learned about each option and found that not all options were required at all times and most were for specific tasks only. Again, after clearing Android and Kotlin, I created a calculator for Android. Yes, I still haven't developed a typing speed speed calculator.

The next thing I learned was Python, C and C++ (yes, again since I had no choice) in the 1st year of my college. The C and Python languages were different to my previous learning languages because they both use different concepts then C++ and Kotlin. C didn't have any OOP and the Python syntax was the most different I had ever seen. But they both serve their own purposes.

I also learned the Dart programming language and a Flutter UI toolkit about myself in my spare time. I found Flutter to be an excellent tool. It helps to create an intuitive user interface and provides many plugins, packages and widgets to easily implement a feature and make customized changes to the user interface. Additionally, flutter is supported by Google and supports most platforms like Android, iOS, Web, Windows, Linux. It facilitates the process of creating and managing applications across different platforms at once. I created a few personal projects using it as a To-Do list app using flutter and Firestore, alarm app and timer, piano app and a few small projects. But my greatest project was to create an application of file tools that I would launch and publish in public very soon. This application would help to work with files such as pictures, PDF files and zip files and perform operations on them like splitting, merging, conversion, etc. Now, in my second year (first quarter), I'm learning and working with Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and it's an interesting and important topic to learn.

At the moment, I like to code because I learn something new every day, meet new people and make new friends.

So, at the bottom of this post, I want to thank you for reading my post. Also, I hope you enjoyed hearing about my computer science journey and that it helped you remember your own. If you're new to this path, I hope my experiences have encouraged you.

Thank you very much,
Have a wonderful day or night.
